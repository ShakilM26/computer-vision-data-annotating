# License Plate Detection – Image Annotation Project

This project demonstrates manual image annotation for license plate detection using [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/).

## 📌 Project Overview
- Annotated images of vehicles to identify and label license plates.
- Created bounding boxes using Roboflow’s browser-based annotation tool.
- Organized dataset for object detection tasks.
- Exported dataset in YOLOv8 and COCO JSON formats.

## 📁 Files
- `annotated_images/`: Sample annotated images.
- `dataset_info/`: Metadata and structure of exported datasets.
- `roboflow_annotations.json`: Raw annotations in JSON format.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Roboflow
- Python (optional future use for training)

## 💡 Goal
The annotated dataset can be used (maybe in future) for training custom object detection models using YOLO, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.
