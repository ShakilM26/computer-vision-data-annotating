# Coin Detection – Custom Image Annotation Project

This project showcases manual image annotation for detecting coins using [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/). All images in this project were captured using a smartphone, making it a fully self-initiated dataset creation task.

## 📌 Project Overview

- Captured real-world coin images under various lighting and background conditions using a mobile phone.
- Annotated each image using bounding boxes in Roboflow to identify and label individual coins.
- Ensured consistency in annotations to make the dataset suitable for training object detection models.
- Exported the dataset in multiple formats (YOLOv9) for future model development.

## 🖼️ Sample Annotations

  <img src="annotated_images/sample2.jpg" alt="Coin Sample 2" width="300"/>
</p>

## 🧰 Tools Used

- 📷 Smartphone Camera (for image collection)
- 🖍️ Roboflow (for annotation)
- 💾 YOLOv9

## The goal of this project is to build a custom annotated dataset for coin detection, which can be used to train and evaluate object detection models like YOLOv5, YOLOv8, or YOLOv9.
